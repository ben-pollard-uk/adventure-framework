Provides simple classes for developing game elements:
  * Hierarchical environments with the following elements:
    * Overworld
    * Region
    * Room
  * NPC's which can be interacted with either with items or conversation.
  * Items which can be interacted with.
    * Items can morph in to other items. For example, using item A on item B may cause item B to morph in to item C.
  
Provides keywords for interacting with game elements:
  * Drop - drop an item.
  * Examine - allows items, characters and environments to be examined.
  * Use - use an item.
  * On - used in conjunction with the Use keyword to use an item on a character, another item or environment.
  * Talk to - talk to a NPC.
  * Take - take an item.
  
Provides global commands to help with game flow:
  * About - display version information.
  * CommandsOn / CommandsOff - toggle commands on/off.
  * Exit - exit the game.
  * Help - display help.
  * Invert - invert the console colours.
  * KeyOn / KeyOff - turn the Key on/off.
  * Map - display the map.
